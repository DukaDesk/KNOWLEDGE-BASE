## 7. Architectural Constraints

1. This repository operates under the DUKADESK Platform Constitution.
2. This repository is the authoritative source of architectural truth for DUKADESK.
3. Implementation repositories must never become the primary source of architecture.
4. All architecture changes require an ADR or RFC before implementation.
5. Terminology must remain consistent with `GLOSSARY.md`.
6. Standards must be traceable to platform principles and constitutional laws.
7. Specifications must be verified against the Knowledge Base before implementation.
8. Engineering governance is consolidated under `engineering-governance/`.

## 8. Known Deviations

| Deviation | Rationale | Review Date |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| No single `src/` root; knowledge domains use top-level directories | This is a knowledge monorepo, not a code monorepo | 2026-07-12 |
| `PROGRESS_REGISTRY.md` used alongside `PROGRESS.md` | Historical artifact retained for detailed tracking | 2026-07-12 |

## 9. Compliance Notes

This repository is the root governance repository. Compliance with the Constitution, Repository Bootstrap standard, and engineering governance is self-verified through the `dukadesk-constitution/`, `engineering-governance/`, and CI validation artifacts.
