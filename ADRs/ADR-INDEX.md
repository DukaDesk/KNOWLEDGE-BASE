> **ADR-013 Note:** Account deactivation uses a 30-day soft deactivation flow (status = `deactivated`, `deactivatedAt`, `scheduledDeletionAt`) before permanent deletion, plus an immediate hard delete option for GDPR/Apple/Google compliance. Reactivation is permitted within the 30-day window. Admin cleanup endpoint purges expired deactivated accounts. Events: `user.deactivated`, `user.reactivated`, `user.permanently_deleted`, `user.auto_deleted_after_30_days`.
