## SDUI & Data Layer

| Component | Status | Notes |

## Known Gaps

1. `MenuGridSection` needs per-item RuntimeNodes for action system add_to_cart (currently uses internal store call + payload dispatch)
2. `FormEngine` (multi-step forms) not yet wired to FormDataContext — standalone `AddressFormSection` is
3. No backend exists — all data is mocked
4. Builder, dashboards not yet started
5. No persistence layer for form data across app restarts
