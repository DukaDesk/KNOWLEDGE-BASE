# DUKADESK Engineering Knowledge Base

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Status:** Drafting
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-11

> **Architecture Progress:** Platform Runtime ✓ | Builder Studio ✓ | Marketplace ✓ | Application Architecture ✓ | Runtime Architecture ✓ | Identity & Access ✓ | Data Platform (16/16 Draft) | Platform Integration (9/13 Draft) | Enterprise Platform Services (6/34 Draft)

## What This Is

This is the **Engineering Knowledge Base** for the DUKADESK platform.

It is the single source of truth for all architectural decisions, engineering standards, platform conventions, and governance processes across the entire DUKADESK ecosystem.

> **The Knowledge Base is the product's memory.** Specifications describe how the platform is built. Implementations produce the software. If a conflict exists, the conflict is resolved through the Knowledge Base — not through code or conversation.

## Usage

Every developer and AI agent MUST read the following before starting work:

1. **README** — this file
2. **PROGRESS_REGISTRY** — current platform status
3. **ADR INDEX** — all decisions made
4. **CORE_PRINCIPLES** — design philosophy
5. **GLOSSARY** — terminology
6. **ENGINEERING STANDARDS** — process rules
7. **Target specification** — the relevant domain spec
8. **ARCHITECTURE** — system architecture, component registry, and related documents

## Core Principles

| # | Principle | Meaning |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **One concept has one definition.** | Every term has a single, authoritative definition. No synonyms. No redefinitions. |
| 2 | **Architecture precedes implementation.** | Architecture decisions are made before code is written. Implementation validates architecture; it does not define it. |
| 3 | **Alignment precedes verification.** | A specification must be reviewed against the Knowledge Base before it can be marked Verified. |
| 4 | **Verified specifications precede implementation.** | Code is written from Verified specifications. Implementation that deviates is a defect. |
| 5 | **The Knowledge Base is the product's memory.** | If a conflict exists, it is resolved through the Knowledge Base — not through code or conversation. |

## Version Tracking

Each governed repository references the Knowledge Base version it aligns with. The Knowledge Base as a whole follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

## Updating the Knowledge Base

When architecture changes:
1. Write an RFC or ADR first
2. Update relevant specifications
3. Update glossary if terminology changed
4. Update the Knowledge Base
5. Only then update implementation repositories

Implementation repositories must NEVER become the primary source of architectural truth.
