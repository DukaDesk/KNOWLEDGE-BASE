## Required Reading

| Minimum Required | Strongly Recommended | Task-Specific |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| DUKADESK Constitution | All constitutional documents | ARCHITECTURE/ (all) |
| README | All KB documents | SPECIFICATIONS/ (target domain) |
| CORE_PRINCIPLES.md | | engineering-governance/ |
| GLOSSARY.md | | |
| ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md | | |
| AGENT_BOOT_PROCESS.md | | |
| PROGRESS_REGISTRY.md | | |
| ADRs/ADR-INDEX.md | | |

## Behavioral Rules
1. Read before writing
2. Treat the Constitution and Knowledge Base as authoritative — they prevail over conversation history or general best practices
3. Do not redefine existing concepts; use GLOSSARY.md as the definitive reference
4. Extend, do not replace existing patterns
5. Flag contradictions — do not silently choose one interpretation
6. Respect ADRs — they are immutable once accepted
7. Cite your sources with specific document names
8. Do not guess — state uncertainty rather than inventing
9. Follow the AI Laws defined in `dukadesk-constitution/AI_LAWS.md`

## Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| Architecture Agent | Cross-cutting architecture decisions |
| Mobile Agent | React Native, Expo, renderer, offline, state |
| Backend Agent | Services, APIs, events, queues, persistence |
| Builder Agent | Visual SDUI builder, authoring, publishing |
| Dashboard Agent | Dashboard specifications |
| Website Agent | Website specifications |
| Documentation Agent | Knowledge Base, developer docs |
| Review Agent | Alignment reports, specification verification |

## Task Lifecycle
1. Receive Task → 2. Load Knowledge Base → 3. Identify Relevant Documents → 4. Review Architecture → 5. Review Standards → 6. Implement → 7. Self Review → 8. Architecture Review → 9. Update Documentation → 10. Update Progress Registry → 11. Complete

## Conflict Resolution
When conflicts are discovered: report the conflict, identify affected documents, recommend alignment review, do not silently modify architecture.
