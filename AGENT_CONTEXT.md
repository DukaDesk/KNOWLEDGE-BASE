- Server-Driven UI (SDUI)
- Runtime and Rendering
- Builder Studio
- Marketplace
- Identity and Access
- Data Platform
- Platform Integration
- Enterprise Platform Services
- Project and Program Management
- AI Agent Bootstrapping

## Supported Systems

- Documentation system (Markdown-based Knowledge Base)
- AI agent context system
- Architecture review system
- Specification verification system
- Repository governance system
- Constitutional governance system

## Knowledge Base Version

This repository aligns with DUKADESK Knowledge Base version **0.1.0** and Engineering Specification version **0.1.0**.

## Repository Rules

1. Read the required documents before writing or editing content.
2. Treat the Constitution and Knowledge Base as authoritative — they prevail over conversation history or general best practices.
3. Use terminology as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Do not redefine concepts.
4. Extend existing patterns; do not silently replace them.
5. Flag contradictions instead of choosing one interpretation silently.
6. Respect accepted ADRs — they are immutable once accepted.
7. Cite sources with specific document names.
8. Do not guess — state uncertainty rather than inventing.
9. Update `PROGRESS_REGISTRY.md` and `PROGRESS.md` when status changes.
10. Follow `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md` for all contributions.
11. Never modify constitutional documents without explicit authorization.

## Coding Standards

This repository contains documentation and governance artifacts. Coding standards for code repositories are defined in `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md` and `STANDARDS/`.

For this repository:

- Write Markdown in clear, structured form.
- Use consistent heading hierarchies.
- Include metadata headers in standards and specifications.
- Keep terminology consistent with `GLOSSARY.md`.
- Reference specific KB documents and ADRs when making claims.

## Forbidden Actions

- Do not modify accepted ADRs.
- Do not introduce undocumented concepts without adding them to the Knowledge Base.
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or environment files.
- Do not bypass the Knowledge Base for convenience.
- Do not make breaking changes to standards without an ADR or RFC.
- Do not duplicate platform capabilities.
- Do not rename established terms without updating `GLOSSARY.md` and all references.

## Cross-Repository Context

- **Upstream dependencies:** None — this is the root Knowledge Base.
- **Downstream consumers:** All DUKADESK implementation repositories (mobile, backend, builder, dashboards, website, SDK, CLI, etc.).
- **Related repositories:** All product and infrastructure repositories in the DUKADESK organization.

## Monorepo Note

This repository is a **knowledge monorepo**. It does not contain a single `src/` directory. Instead, source content is organized by domain:

- `dukadesk-constitution/` — supreme governing documents
- `engineering-governance/` — consolidated engineering governance
  - `repository-governance/` — repository standards
  - `developer-experience/` — developer guides and processes
  - `repository-bootstrap/` — repository bootstrap package
  - `execution-governance/` — compliance, quality, ownership
- `ARCHITECTURE/` — architecture documents
- `SPECIFICATIONS/` — domain specifications
- `STANDARDS/` — engineering conventions
- `GUIDES/` — implementation guides
- `ADRs/` — architecture decision records
- `knowledge-base/` — extended knowledge base domains
- `project-management/` — roadmap, milestones, RFCs
- `engineering-specifications/` — extended engineering specifications
- Product directories (`mobile/`, `backend/`, `builder/`, etc.) — implementation stubs or early artifacts

AI agents must treat this layout as the canonical structure for this repository and must not impose a single `src/` root.
