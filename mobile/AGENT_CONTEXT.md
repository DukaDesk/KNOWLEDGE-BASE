## Specification Traceability

Specifications that target this repository:

| Specification | Title | State |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| | | |

## Agent Conventions

- Reference engineering specifications by ID in commits and pull requests.
- Follow platform-specific accessibility guidelines.
- Keep UI components testable and reusable.
- Securely store tokens and credentials.
- Update this context when responsibilities or structure change.

## Common Tasks

- Implement a UI specification: build screens, components, and navigation.
- Integrate an API: add service client and state updates.
- Handle push notifications: follow EVT-XXXX and platform docs.

## Escalation

Stop and ask for human input when:

- A change requires native module changes.
- A security-critical decision is required.
- A platform-specific store policy is involved.
