# Engineering Work Management

This repository is the central work management layer for DUKADESK OS. It sits between Engineering Specifications and implementation repositories, translating approved specifications into actionable, traceable, and verifiable work.

## Purpose

Engineering Work Management defines how work is structured, assigned, prioritized, estimated, tracked, and verified. It ensures every line of implementation can be traced back to a specification, an ADR, and the knowledge base.

## Work Item Types

| Type | Prefix | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Epic | EPIC-0001 | Owns a business objective |
| Feature | FEAT-0001 | Implements part of an Epic |
| Task | TASK-0001 | Atomic unit of implementation |
| Bug | BUG-0001 | Defect or incident fix |
| Spike | SPIKE-0001 | Time-boxed research or exploration |

## Dependency Rules

- No Task exists without a parent Feature.
- No Feature exists without a parent Epic.
- No Epic exists without an Engineering Specification.
- No Engineering Specification exists without a Knowledge Base reference.

## Getting Started

1. Read [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md).
2. Check [STATUS_MODEL.md](STATUS_MODEL.md) for state definitions.
3. Use a template from [templates/](templates/) to create a work item.
4. Register the work item in the appropriate registry index.
5. Move it through the lifecycle.

## Governance

This repository is governed by [Repository Governance](../repository-governance/) and informed by [Engineering Specifications](../engineering-specifications/).
