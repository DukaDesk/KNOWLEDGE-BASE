# Builder Agent Context

## Overview

The `builder/` repository contains the visual builder and configuration tools that allow users to design and customize DUKADESK OS experiences.

## Responsibilities

- Visual design and layout canvas
- Component palette and property editors
- Preview and simulation
- Export and serialization of designs
- Builder-specific state management

## Non-Responsibilities

- Runtime rendering of end-user applications
- Core business logic
- Infrastructure provisioning

## Technology Stack

- Framework: TBD (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte)
- Canvas / Editor: TBD
- State Management: TBD
- Testing: TBD

## Specification Traceability

Specifications that target this repository:

| Specification | Title | State |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| | | |

## Agent Conventions

- Reference engineering specifications by ID in commits and pull requests.
- Keep the canvas performant for large designs.
- Validate serialized output against schemas.
- Maintain undo/redo and autosave behavior.
- Update this context when responsibilities or structure change.

## Common Tasks

- Add a new component: follow UI-XXXX and register it in the palette.
- Implement a property editor: follow FEAT-XXXX and add tests.
- Update serialization format: follow DB-XXXX and migration rules.

## Escalation

Stop and ask for human input when:

- A change affects the serialized design format.
- A performance regression is introduced.
- A decision impacts the runtime rendering contract.
