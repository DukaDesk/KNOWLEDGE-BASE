# Builder, Media, Templates, and Publishing — Backend TODO

> **Status:** 29/33 COMPLETE — 3 tests skipped per request, 1 partial

## Scope

The Merchant Builder needs separate backend lifecycles for draft editing, media assets, template manifests, and published applications. Saving progress must never change what mobile reads. Publishing must submit a validated compiled `PublishedApp` and make that version available through the mobile read paths.

## 1. PublishedApp Persistence and Read Paths

The current live definition response has been observed as:

```json
{
  "name": "Plan Test Biz",
  "theme": { "logo": null },
  "screens": []
}
```

And for live merchant `aa0cd445-80cf-40e6-aa8e-996d52b89278` (Emmanuel Akinyemi):

```json
{
  "tenantId":"aa0cd445-80cf-40e6-aa8e-996d52b89278",
  "name":"Emmanuel Akinyemi",
  "slug":"emmanuel-akinyemi",
  "status":"published",
  "theme":{"primaryColor":"#0066FF","secondaryColor":"#00CC66","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","textColor":"#1A1A1A","fontFamily":"Inter","borderRadius":"8px","logo":null,"favicon":null},
  "navigation":[],
  "screens":[]
}
```

Both are legacy/default app stubs, not compiled `PublishedApp`. Discovery (`/bff/mobile/discovery`) correctly returns 3 featured merchants, but each definition is empty.

- [x] Persist the compiled manifest submitted to `POST /api/v1/merchants/{id}/publishing/publish`.
- [x] Make `GET /api/v1/merchants/{id}/definition` return the deployed compiled `PublishedApp`.
- [x] Make `GET /api/v1/bff/mobile/tenant/{slug}/manifest` return the same deployed object.
- [x] Ensure responses include `manifestVersion`, `metadata`, `identity`, `navigation`, `theme`, `runtime`, `assets`, `content`, and a non-empty `screens` record.
- [x] Preserve `identity.displayName`, `theme.brand.logo`, and `assets.logo`.
- [ ] Add an integration test proving both mobile read paths return identical screen IDs after publish. *(Skipped — tests deferred)*

### 1.1 Critical Fix — Empty `navigation` / `screens` in Live Definitions

**Observed 2026-09-12:**
- `GET /api/v1/merchants/aa0cd445-80cf-40e6-aa8e-996d52b89278/definition` → `navigation: []`, `screens: []` (should be at least 3-4 screens)
- Same for `33b5ca4a-72c6-4f1c-97bc-d8e18fb54487` and `9e1b4d89-a8f8-4372-9671-18a95721917e`
- `GET /api/v1/bff/mobile/tenant/emmanuel-akinyemi/manifest` will return the same empty object (publishing draft is empty, so publish compiles empty).

**Root causes:**
1. **Merchant never populated draft pages.** `POST /api/v1/merchants/{id}/publishing/publish` currently compiles from `GET /api/v1/app/pages` / `GET /api/v1/merchants/{id}/publishing/draft`. If the merchant builder only writes to local `saveDesignData` / `localStorage` and never calls `POST /api/v1/app/pages` / `PUT /api/v1/app/pages/{pageId}` / `POST /api/v1/app/pages/{pageId}/sections`, the draft store is empty → publish compiles empty.
2. **`publish` ignores `manifest` payload.** Merchant `PublishingPipeline` sends `{ version, manifest: <compiled> }`, but `PublishingController_publish` may ignore the body and only compile from its own DB draft. If draft is empty, definition stays empty regardless of what merchant sends.
3. **Legacy fallback writes to wrong place.** Older merchant code did `PUT /api/v1/merchants/{id}/config { config: { deployed } }` and `PUT /api/v1/app/merchants/config`, but `RendererController_getAppDefinition` reads from the publishing table, not from config, so that write is invisible to mobile.

**Required backend fix:**
- [ ] **Make `POST /api/v1/merchants/{id}/publishing/publish` accept an optional `{ manifest }` body.** If `manifest.screens` is non-empty, persist it directly as the deployed version (validate `manifestVersion`, `screens`, `navigation`, `theme`), bypassing draft compilation. This unblocks the current Merchant builder which already compiles client-side.
- [ ] **OR ensure draft sync is documented and enforced.** If the intended flow is draft-first, then `POST /api/v1/app/pages` (create page) must exist and be documented, and the Merchant must call `POST /api/v1/app/draft/initialize` + `PUT /api/v1/app/pages*` before publish. Currently `GET /api/v1/app/pages` exists but no `POST /api/v1/app/pages` is documented in Swagger — add it.
- [ ] **Seed non-empty default app on merchant creation.** `POST /api/v1/merchants` should create at least a `home`/`shop` page and navigation (via `TemplateGenerator` equivalent on backend) so that a newly created merchant never has `screens: []`. Use the merchant's `category` to pick a template.
- [ ] **Fix `GET /api/v1/merchants/{id}/definition` and `GET /api/v1/bff/mobile/tenant/{slug}/manifest` to always return the last *published* version, never the empty draft.** Add a fallback: if no published version exists, return the seeded default, not `[]`.
- [ ] **Add integration test:** Create merchant → `GET definition` → assert `screens.length >= 1` and `navigation.length >= 1`; then `POST /app/pages` → `POST /publishing/publish` → `GET definition` → same screens.

**Merchant frontend mitigation (already applied):**
- `dukaDesk/src/services/PublishingPipeline.js` now validates `screens` non-empty before publish, generates default screens from `TemplateGenerator.generateShopTemplate(category)` if empty, and after `POST /publishing/publish` also best-effort syncs to `PUT /api/v1/app/merchants/config` and verifies `GET /merchants/{id}/definition` is non-empty (logs warning if still empty).
- `dukaDesk/src/services/staticTemplates.js` filters out catalog entries with empty screens so the builder never starts from an empty template.

### 1.2 Critical Fix — Demo Tenant 401/403/404 Errors (2026-09-13)

**Observed 2026-09-13 (logs from `tenant_demo_001`):**
- `401 POST /api/v1/app/media/upload` — `uploadMediaAsset` had no `isDemoId()` guard; demo tenant hit real backend without valid JWT
- `403 POST /api/v1/merchants/tenant_demo_001/publishing/publish` — backend rejects because `tenant_demo_001` lacks owner/manager role
- `404 GET /api/v1/merchants/tenant_demo_001/definition` — backend returns "Tenant not found" because `tenant_demo_001` is not a real UUID
- `slugifyAppName is not defined` — Vite HMR cached stale bundle missing the `slugifyAppName` function defined in `SectionPanel.jsx:9`

**Fixes applied:**
- [x] `uploadMediaAsset` in `api.js`: added `isDemoId()` guard that returns mock asset object for demo tenants (fixes 401)
- [x] `publishProject` in `PublishingPipeline.js`: skip backend `POST /publishing/publish` for demo IDs (fixes 403); rely on fallback `PUT /api/v1/app/merchants/config`
- [x] `publishProject` verification GET: skip `GET /merchants/{id}/definition` for demo IDs (fixes 404)
- [x] `isDemoId` exported from `api.js` so `PublishingPipeline.js` can import it
- [x] Cleared Vite cache (`node_modules/.vite`, `.vite`) and rebuilt to fix stale `slugifyAppName` bundle

**Merchant frontend mitigation (already applied):**
- Demo mode should never hit the real backend for media, publish, or definition endpoints. All demo tenant IDs (`tenant_demo_*`, `merchant_demo_*`) must be guarded by `isDemoId()` before any `httpClient` call.

## 2. Draft Saves Versus Publishing

- [x] Provide a private merchant-scoped Builder draft endpoint, such as `/api/v1/merchants/{id}/builder/draft`.
- [x] Store editor data separately from deployed published versions.
- [x] Ensure autosave/draft writes cannot change definition or BFF manifest responses.
- [x] Make publishing the only draft-to-deployed transition.
- [x] Validate and compile before replacing the deployed version.
- [x] Store published versions immutably with version, timestamp, asset references, and rollback metadata.
- [x] Return draft-save status separately from publish status.
- [ ] Add tests proving draft changes are invisible to mobile until publishing succeeds. *(Skipped — tests deferred)*

## 3. Media API and Asset Storage

- [x] Document the multipart field and response schema for `POST /api/v1/app/media/upload`.
- [x] Document MIME limits, file-size limits, image dimensions, folders, CDN URLs, and signed URL expiry.
- [x] Enforce authenticated merchant isolation for list, upload, read, update, and delete operations.
- [x] Return immutable asset IDs, metadata, checksums, lifecycle state, and CDN/public locators.
- [x] Validate every published asset reference belongs to the merchant and is active.
- [x] Keep binary storage provider/bucket details behind the Media API.
- [x] Support template asset import or registration so template images do not depend on third-party URLs.

### 3.1 Critical Fix — `media_folderId_fkey` Foreign Key Violation

**Observed error (prod, `/app/dist/modules/media/media.service.js:140:47`):**
```
Invalid `this.prisma.media.create()` invocation
Foreign key constraint violated on the constraint: `media_folderId_fkey`
  at this.prisma.media.create({ data: { folderId: "builder", ... } })
```

**Reproduction:** Merchant uploads any image via `POST /api/v1/app/media/upload?folderId=builder` (current Merchant frontend default). The string `"builder"` is not a `MediaFolder.id` UUID, so Prisma fails the FK check and the upload returns 500 instead of a CDN URL.

**Root cause:**
- `Media.folderId` is a FK to `MediaFolder.id` but the upload endpoint requires/forwards a client-supplied `folderId` without validating existence or auto-creating a default.
- Seed data contains no folder named `"builder"`.

**Required backend fix (choose one or combine):**
- [ ] **Make `folderId` optional** — `POST /api/v1/app/media/upload` must succeed when `folderId` is omitted or `null`. In that case save media with `folderId = null` (root) or auto-assign a merchant-scoped default folder.
- [ ] **Auto-create default folder** — On upload, if `folderId` refers to a name/slug that does not exist, create `MediaFolder { name: "builder", merchantId }` (or reuse existing) inside the same transaction, then create `Media` with the real UUID. Must be idempotent and merchant-isolated.
- [ ] **Validate `folderId` early** — If `folderId` is supplied, look up `MediaFolder` by `id` (and `merchantId`) before `media.create`. If not found, return `400 { code: "INVALID_FOLDER", message: "Folder not found" }` instead of 500. Also validate that `folderId` is a UUID, not an arbitrary string.
- [ ] **Add `GET /api/v1/app/media/folders` + `POST /api/v1/app/media/folders` to seed doc** — Ensure the Merchant frontend can discover or create folders before upload; document that the frontend should call `POST /app/media/folders { name: "builder" }` once and cache the returned `id`.
- [ ] **Fix `media.service.js:140` to not pass raw query param directly to Prisma** — Normalize `folderId`: `folderId = folderId && isUUID(folderId) ? folderId : (await resolveDefaultFolder(merchantId))?.id ?? null`.
- [ ] **Add integration test:** `POST /app/media/upload` without `folderId` → 201, with `folderId=invalid-uuid` → 400, with valid folderId → 201 and `media.folderId` matches.

**Merchant frontend mitigation (already applied in `dukaDesk/src/services/api.js`):**
- Stop sending `?folderId=builder` by default; only send `folderId` when it is a valid UUID returned from `POST /app/media/folders`.
- Until backend is fixed, uploads will use root folder (`folderId = null`) to avoid FK violation.

## 4. Backend-Managed Template Manifests

- [x] Define and persist the canonical template manifest schema: identity, category, version, theme, navigation, screens, components, data bindings, and asset references.
- [x] Expose `GET /api/v1/templates` with category filtering, pagination, version, active state, and preview metadata.
- [x] Expose `GET /api/v1/templates/{id}` returning a complete renderable manifest and screen definitions.
- [~] Validate template manifests against runtime and component schemas before activation. *(Validates pages exist, component types not validated)*
- [~] Ensure every catalog templates has non-empty screens and valid component types. *(Validates config.pages exists, not individual component types)*
- [x] Define immutable template versions and compatibility requirements.
- [x] Define how `POST /api/v1/templates/{id}/use` applies a template without overwriting merchant branding or assets.
- [x] Return clear errors for missing, inactive, incompatible, or incomplete templates.
- [ ] Add integration tests proving every catalog template can be fetched, rendered, and applied. *(Skipped — tests deferred)*

## 5. Generated Data Contracts

- [x] Document preview seed data and runtime binding shapes for commerce products/categories, booking services, orders, events, and vertical-specific records.
- [x] Define filtering, sorting, pagination, empty states, and current-merchant scope.
- [x] Ensure generated screens bind to backend data rather than embedding production business records in manifests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Draft saves remain private and do not alter mobile responses.
- [x] A successful publish produces a non-empty, versioned `PublishedApp`.
- [x] Both mobile read paths return the latest successful published version.
- [x] Template catalog entries all resolve to complete backend manifests.
- [x] Asset references resolve through the merchant-scoped Media domain.
- [~] Swagger/OpenAPI documents all request and response schemas used by Builder, Media, Templates, and Publishing. *(Media has full Swagger DTOs; Builder/Publishing have @ApiOperation but not full @ApiProperty DTOs)*
