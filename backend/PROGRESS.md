# Backend Progress

This file tracks the current state of the backend implementation repository. **Terminology:** an **app** is the published experience owned by a **merchant**; **users** are mobile customers. Legacy backend paths may still contain `tenant`, but app-owner reads and writes use the `/api/v1/app/*` scope.

**KB Version:** 0.3.8
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-24

## Active Work

Primary open plan: [Published app delivery backend TODO](PUBLISHED_APP_DELIVERY_BACKEND_TODO.md) (B1–B3, B5–B6 implemented 2026-09-24; B4 migration ready for deploy via Railway `migrate deploy`, B7 compatibility, B8 live integration evidence remain). Incident checklist: [Published logo and release mismatch TODO](PUBLISHED_LOGO_RELEASE_MISMATCH_TODO.md). Media/folder checklist: [Builder Media API backend TODO](BUILDER_MEDIA_API_BACKEND_TODO.md).

## Architecture: Three-Tier Endpoint Model

| Tier | Path Prefix | Audience | Auth | Purpose |
|------|-------------|----------|------|---------|
| **Website (Platform)** | `/admin/*`, `/auth/*`, `/discovery/*`, `/templates/*`, `/bff/website/*` | Platform operators | JWT / Public | Registration, tenant creation, admin ops |
| **App (Tenant Self-Service)** | `/app/*` | Tenant owners/managers | JWT + `@CurrentUser` | Write + config for own tenant (auto-resolved via `TenantResolverService`) |
| **Mobile/Consumer** | `/merchants/:merchantId/*` | End users (public) | `@Public()` | Read-only catalog, booking, checkout |

**Tenant Resolution:** `TenantResolverService` finds `TenantUser` where `role IN ['owner','manager']` and `status='active'`, picks first with `owner` priority.

**Controller Pattern:**
- `*AppController` — JWT + `@CurrentUser`, auto-resolves tenantId
- `*PublicController` — `@Public()` with explicit `:merchantId` param

## Client implementation alignment (2026-09-18)

The backend contract is implemented and deployed, but the two clients are at different
integration stages:

- **DukaDesk mobile:** live discovery, published-definition resolution, BFF manifest
  fallback, authenticated `/app/commerce/*` cart/order/tax calls, and guest-mode
  gating are wired. Identity, nearby discovery, order history, and order detail
  now use live endpoint modules rather than repository demo records. The deployed
  BFF may return the published runtime screens under
  `data.config.config.deployed.screens`, `data.config.config.screens`, or the
  older `data.config.screens`; the mobile resolver handles all three shapes.
  Published storefront manifests also support the merchant editor's
  `promotion_list` component; the mobile runtime renders its offer cards
  instead of showing an unsupported-component fallback.
  TypeScript and Jest validation are part of the client quality gate.
- **DUKA-MERCHANT/dukadesk:** dashboard, builder, app configuration, publishing,
  public definition reads, and BFF manifest parity checks are wired. Design/config
  persistence uses `/api/v1/app/merchants/config`; the removed
  `/merchants/:id/publishing/draft` shortcut was not part of the current contract.
- **Publishing pipeline validation:** release history is fetched once per publish,
  preventing version calculation and release persistence from diverging when the
  history provider is transient or mocked. Empty screen collections still receive
  the documented template fallback, while existing screen definitions are preserved.
- **Client validation (2026-09-18):** merchant production build and complete Vitest
  suite pass; DukaDesk Jest suite passes (45 tests) and its TypeScript check passes.
- **Backend-dependent gaps:** saved addresses and payment methods remain blocked
  until their APIs are implemented. The mobile profile screens show an explicit
  unavailable state; live flows must not silently promote demo records.

## Next Up

- Verify `prisma migrate deploy` applied `20260924000000_add_active_release` after Railway deploy; confirm backfill + conflict audit
- Publish machine-readable compatibility contract + merchant preflight (B7)
- Live e2e publish/rollback/read-path/media evidence (B8)
- E2E integration tests for all modules
- Rate limiting and throttling configuration (quota defaults + docs)
- API versioning strategy (v2 planning)
- Performance optimization and query tuning
- Monitoring and alerting setup
