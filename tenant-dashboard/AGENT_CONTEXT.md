## Agent Conventions

- Reference engineering specifications by ID in commits and pull requests.
- Enforce tenant isolation in all data-fetching and mutations.
- Reuse shared UI components where applicable.
- Keep workflows simple and responsive.
- Update this context when responsibilities or structure change.

## Common Tasks

- Implement a tenant screen: follow UI-XXXX and API-XXXX.
- Add a workflow: follow WF-XXXX and add end-to-end tests.
- Update settings: follow FEAT-XXXX and security guidance.

## Escalation

Stop and ask for human input when:

- A change crosses tenant boundaries.
- A security-critical decision is required.
- A decision impacts subscription tiers or entitlements.
