## Specification Traceability

Specifications that target this repository:

| Specification | Title | State |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| | | |

## Agent Conventions

- Reference engineering specifications by ID in commits and pull requests.
- Use consistent command naming and help text.
- Protect credentials and configuration files.
- Support JSON and human-readable output where appropriate.
- Update this context when responsibilities or structure change.

## Common Tasks

- Add a command: follow FEAT-XXXX and add integration tests.
- Update configuration handling: follow SEC-XXXX.
- Release a binary: follow [RELEASE_STANDARD](../repository-governance/RELEASE_STANDARD.md).

## Escalation

Stop and ask for human input when:

- A change affects credential storage or authentication.
- A command signature becomes breaking.
- A decision impacts cross-platform distribution.
